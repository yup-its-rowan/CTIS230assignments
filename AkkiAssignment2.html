            <h1> Lab 5: Method of Mixture </h1>

            <h3> Abstract:</h3>

            <p>In this experiment, we are trying gain familiarity with using the method of mixtures to measure the specific heat of a metal sample. To determine the specific heat of our sample, after heating our sample in boiling water inside our calorimeter cup of cold water. We then took the values measured by the temperature probe of the calorimeter cup to determine the specific heat of the sample. By using the heat capacity formula and solving for specific heat, we used the data from our temperature graphs and the masses of the two to reach our own calculations for the specific heat of our sample.</p>

            <h3>Raw Data:</h3>
            <p>Calorimeter Cup = 27.5 g <br> Calorimter Cup With Water = 155.8 g</p>
            <p> Styrofoam Cup = 5.2 g<br> Styrofoam Cup With Water = 410.7 g</p>
            <p> Brass Cube = 137.3 g </p>
            <p>Starting Temperature = 12.5â„ƒ </p>
            

            <h3>Calculations:</h3>
            <p>Uncertainty of C = (Um*umu)2+(UTh*Th)2+Uac*ac)2+(UTc*Tc)2</p>
            
            <p>
                Uncertainty of C = +/- .080 J/gmK<br>
                Uncertainty of C2 = +/- .016 J/gmK<br>
                Calculated C = 0.321 +/- 0.080 J/gmK<br>
                Calculated C2 = 0.398 +/- 0.016 J/gmK<br>
                Actual C = 0.377
            </p>
            
            <h3>Analysis:</h3>
            
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Our values are within two standard deviations of the actual Specific heat of brass, which is .380 J/gmK. The 2 calculated Cs  0.321 +/- 0.080 J/gmK and 0.398 +/- 0.016 J/gmK agree with the accepted value.</li>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The styrofoam cup gave a closer approximation to the actual C of brass, which was .018 J/gmK off of the actual C value. The calorimeter, on the other hand was .059  J/gmK off of the actual C value. So according to our results, the styrofoam was more accurate than the calorimeter.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>This experiment could be improved by collecting data for a longer amount of time to get a more accurate result. More accurate thermometers would also lead to better and more accurate results. The brass could also be heated directly, assuming even heating, to a certain temperature, instead of being put in boiling water, because if the brass was put in the water for different amounts of time, the Hot Temperature would be different. This could be avoided by directly heating the brass evenly, or measuring the amount of time that the brass was in the water to get consistency in that regard. </li>
                    <br>
                </ol>
            </p>    
            
            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>Our calculated values for the specific heat of our sample for both tests were within the range of uncertainty of the actual specific heat. The correlation could be furthered, however, with more accurate thermometers, longer/more data collection periods, and a more precise temperature of the brass. These factors can all be related to issues of human error.</p>
