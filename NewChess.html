            <ul>
                <li>Only three quarters of the board are usable</li>
                <li>No piece may travel over no-mans land</li>
                <li>Pawns may move and attack in the ways turning the corner in the corner quarter but no other</li>
                <li>Pawns may not move back into previous corners</li>
                <li>Kings may capture pieces by jumping over them</li>
                <li>Knights and pawns may occupy the same square, allowing the pawn to ride along</li>
                <li>Knight Riders cannot attack while grouped up</li>
                <li>Bishop interactions will be determined by the player who screams the loudest</li>
                <li>If a knight or a knight rider lands beside a knight and a d10 gives a 6 or higher, the other knight is converted to your army</li>
                <li>Pieces may be captured if they are surrounded by a number of pawns, which will all conglomerate onto one square</li>
                <li>A bipawn will act like a pawn with twice the movement and attack length, with tripawn and quadpawn in similar</li>
                <li>Bipawns, tripawns, and quadpawns may split up, as may knight riders</li>
            </ul>
